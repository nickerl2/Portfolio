# Portfolio
Adam Nickerl's portfolio, showcasing artifacts demonstrating test engineering, software engineering, and testing automation.

### About me:
Hi, I'm Adam Nickerl ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-nickerl-480b15168/)). I'm an engineer with experience in both developing and testing software. In my free time, I like exercising, especially power lifting and ultra-running. My creative hobbies include game development, reading and reviewing fantasy and sci-fi novels, creative writing, and drawing. I like listening to lectures on philosophy, self-improvement, neuroscience, and health. I occasionally play video games--my favorite genres are turn-based strategy RPGs and narrative-focused games.

### Experience & Accolades:

* Certified ISTQB Foundation Level tester
* Full-time software test engineer at Aurora Innovation, Inc. for 2 years
  * Building scripts to help adjacent teams, constructing pipelines for test data automation, constructing visualization tooling for the simulation engine
* Full-time test engineer at Uber ATG and Aurora Innovation, Inc. for 2 years
  * Working largely in the test levels north of "component integration," though I occasionally built scripts or tools to assist with log data parsing and visualization
  * I was also partially "loaned" out to a team for a period of 2-3 months in which I constructed components for an "auto-grader" system, which evaluated AV simulation performance based on log data produced by the simulations
* Test engineering internship at Uber ATG, primarily working on test case refinement for safety-critical tests
* Co-authored research paper: "[Full-Duplex Jamming for Enhanced Hidden-Key Secrecy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8761586)"
* B.S. in Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University

### Tools:
* Programming languages - Proficient: Java, C++, Python; Familiar: C#, C, MATLAB
* Version control - familiar with best practices (used git at Uber ATG, used a proprietary version control software at Aurora)
* Jira - automating ticket creation corresponding to test cases for Localization system of the Aurora's Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
* Documentation - brief exposure to Atlassian Confluence at Aurora, swapped to in-house documentation/wiki after a couple of months
* Spreadsheets - lots of experience navigating & creating Google Sheets, experience creating visualizations using spreadsheet data, (very light) experience with Excel/Sheets scripting
* Data visualization - Python scripts & Jupyter notebooks to manipulate and visualize AV log data (primarily ballistics)
* IDEs - Experience working in numerous IDEs, including Jetbrains suite (IntelliJ/Rider), Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and Atom
* Web browser automation - Coursework in Selenium
* Game/simulation engines - experience building tooling for dataflow and visualization within Aurora's in-house simulation engine; amateur-enthusiast experience using Unity for game development
* Assorted build & test tools - Bazel, Junit, Selenium, Pytest, GoogleTest
* Operating Systems - familiarity with working in Windows, MacOS, and Linux environments, including an beginner/intermediate grasp on CLI manipulations

### Tech skills
* Basics of software testing: [ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL)](https://www.istqb.org/certifications/certified-tester-foundation-level)
* Experience working in multiple SWDL models, including traditional waterfall and a more agile-based organization
* Data Structures & Algorithms - recently remastered by taking the extremely rigorous University of Utah's Algorithms and Data Structures course, receiving an A+
* Experience programming in OOP and Functional programming paradigms
* Testing methodologies - black-box testing (partition testing, BVA testing, decision table testing, & state transition testing) & white-box testing (statement & branch coverage)
* Meticulous documentation & docstrings/commenting - just a little obsessive about neat code
